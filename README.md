# This project use list of fundamental React Concept
- Components: Building the UI with reusable functional components.
- JSX: Using JSX syntax to define the component structure, making it easy to write HTML-like code within JavaScript for rendering UI element
- State Management: Using the useState hook for managing local component states, such as tracking cart items, wishlist or order history.
- Effects (useEffect): Using the useEffect hook for side effects, like fetching product data from an JSON file.

- Routing: Using react-router-dom to handle client-side routing for pages like the home page, product details, dashboard page and order history providing a seamless user experience across pages without page reloads.

- Event Handling: Attaching event handlers to respond to user actions, like adding an item to the cart, sorting products by price, or removing an item from the wishlist.

- Conditional Rendering: Dynamically displaying elements based on certain conditions, such as showing a "No Product Add Cart and Wishlist".
- useLocation: useLocation help render different components or styles based on the current path. For instance, user is on the /dashboard page, might want to navbar color change.

# Used for handling and managing data(Context API)
In this project, Context API is used to handle and manage global state, making data accessible across components without passing props down multiple levels. This is particularly helpful for managing features like the cart, wishlist, and order history.

- Provide Global State: With Context, create a central store for data (e.g., cart items, wishlist items, order history items), which all components can access and update as needed.

- Avoid Prop Drilling: Instead of passing data through multiple layers of components, Context allows direct access to state, simplifying component structure.
